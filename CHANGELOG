## v0.2.0 - WIP

- Add `PhysicsPipeline::remove_collider(...)` to remove a collider from the `ColliderSet`.
- Add `ColliderDesc::translation(...)` to set the translation of a collider relative to the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Add `ColliderDesc::rotation(...)` to set the rotation of a collider relative to the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Add `ColliderDesc::position(...)` to set the position of a collider relative to the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Add `Collider::position_wrt_parent()` to get the position of a collider relative to the rigid-body it is attached to.
- Modify `RigidBody::set_position(...)` so it also resets the next kinematic position to the same value.
- Deprecate `Collider::delta()` in favor of the new `Collider::position_wrt_parent()`.
- Fix multiple issues occurring when having colliders resulting in a non-zero center-of-mass.
- Fix a crash happening when removing a rigid-body with a collider, stepping the simulation, adding another rigid-body
 with a collider, and stepping the simulation again.
